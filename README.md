# Self-Surveillance-Robot
Self Surveillance robot makes use of Artificial Intelligence and RADAR technology to detect proximity of an object to the robot, with mobile surveillance being an added advantage.

The aim of the project is to create a system that moves around the path specified by the designer and detect objects in its path and give the information back to the user. It uses a line follower robot along with ultrasonic sensor which detects the objects in the path. All this is done without intervention of humans.

Areas of application includes-
•	Industrial automated equipment carriers.
•	Automated cars.
•	For security purposes.
•	For military application.
•	Tour guides in museums and other similar applications.
•	Space exploration (example: Curiosity rover (mars)
