# Self-Surveillance-Robot
Self Surveillance robot uses the concepts of Artificial Intelligence and Radar to detect any objects near the proximity of the robot ,with mobile surveillance being an added advantage.  
  

The aim of the project is to create a system that moves around the path specified by the designer and detect objects in its path and give the information back to the user. It uses a line follower robot along with ultrasonic sensor which detects the objects in the path. All this is done without intervention of humans.  
  
Area of application includes-  
•	Industrial automated equipment carriers.   
•	Automated cars.  
•	For security purpose.  
•	For military application.  
•	Tour guides in museums and other similar applications.  
•	Space exploration .(example: Curiosity rover (mars))
